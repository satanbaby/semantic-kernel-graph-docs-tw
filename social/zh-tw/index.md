# Semantic Kernel Graph

Welcome to the SemanticKernel.Graph documentation. This site mirrors the LangGraph documentation structure, focusing on a lean and pragmatic .NET implementation that's fully integrated with Semantic Kernel.

## Concepts and Techniques

**SemanticKernel.Graph**: Extension of Semantic Kernel that adds computational graph execution capabilities, allowing you to create complex workflows with intelligent orchestration.

**Computational Graphs**: Structures that represent workflows through nodes connected by edges, with controlled execution and conditional routing.

**Native Integration**: Works as an extension of the existing Semantic Kernel, maintaining full compatibility and leveraging existing plugins and services.

## What SemanticKernel.Graph Solves

### Orchestration Problems
* **Complex Workflows**: Creation of AI pipelines with multiple steps
* **Intelligent Routing**: Decisions based on state and context
* **Flow Control**: Loops, conditionals and controlled iterations
* **Composition**: Reuse of components and subgraphs

### Production Challenges
* **Scalability**: Parallel and distributed execution
* **Resilience**: Checkpointing, retry and circuit breakers
* **Observability**: Metrics, logging and real-time visualization
* **Maintainability**: Debug, inspection and automatic documentation

## Core Features

### **Graph Execution**
* Function, conditional, reasoning and loop nodes
* Edges with conditions and dynamic routing
* Sequential, parallel and distributed execution
* Deterministic scheduler for reproducibility

### **Streaming and Events**
* Streaming execution with real-time events
* Automatic reconnection and backpressure control
* Asynchronous consumption of execution events
* Integration with messaging systems

### **State and Persistence**
* Typed and validated state system
* Automatic and manual checkpointing
* State serialization and compression
* Execution recovery and replay

### **Intelligent Routing**
* State-based conditional routing
* Dynamic and adaptive strategies
* Semantic similarity for decisions
* Learning from feedback

### **Human-in-the-Loop**
* Human approval nodes
* Multiple channels (console, web, email)
* Timeouts and SLA policies
* Audit and decision tracking

### **Integration and Extensibility**
* Integrated REST tools
* Extensible plugin system
* Integration with external services
* Templates for common workflows

## Get Started in Minutes

### 1. **Quick Installation**
```bash
dotnet add package SemanticKernel.Graph
```

### 2. **First Graph**
```csharp
builder.AddGraphSupport();
var kernel = builder.Build();

// Create graph executor (not a Graph class)
var executor = new GraphExecutor("MyGraph", "My first graph");

// Add nodes and edges
executor.AddNode(startNode);
executor.AddNode(processNode);
executor.AddNode(endNode);

executor.SetStartNode(startNode.NodeId);
executor.AddEdge(ConditionalEdge.CreateUnconditional(startNode, processNode));
executor.AddEdge(ConditionalEdge.CreateUnconditional(processNode, endNode));

// Execute the graph
var result = await executor.ExecuteAsync(kernel, arguments);
```

> **Important Note**: The SemanticKernel.Graph library uses `GraphExecutor` class, not a `Graph` class. This is different from some other graph libraries. The `GraphExecutor` serves both as the graph definition and execution engine.
