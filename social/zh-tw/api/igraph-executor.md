# IGraphExecutor

The `IGraphExecutor` interface defines the public contract for executing graphs built on top of Semantic Kernel. It abstracts the execution engine to enable mocking, dependency inversion, and consistent behavior across different implementations.

## Overview

`IGraphExecutor` serves as the core execution contract that orchestrates graph workflows. It manages the complete execution lifecycle, from initialization to completion, while providing safeguards against infinite loops and ensuring predictable behavior.

## Contract and Semantics

### Core Execution Method

The primary method `ExecuteAsync` orchestrates graph execution from a configured start node until completion or cancellation:

```csharp
Task<FunctionResult> ExecuteAsync(
    Kernel kernel,
    KernelArguments arguments,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
```

**Parameters:**
* `kernel`: The Semantic Kernel instance used to resolve functions, prompts, memory, and other services
* `arguments`: The execution state and inputs as `KernelArguments`; updated values may be written during execution
* `cancellationToken`: A token for cooperative cancellation

**Returns:** A `FunctionResult` representing the terminal result of the graph execution

**Exceptions:**
* `ArgumentNullException`: Thrown if `kernel` or `arguments` is null
* `OperationCanceledException`: Thrown if the operation is canceled via `cancellationToken`

### Node Execution Methods

#### ExecuteNodeAsync
Executes a single graph node in isolation:

```csharp
Task<FunctionResult> ExecuteNodeAsync(
    IGraphNode node,
    Kernel kernel,
    KernelArguments arguments,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
```

This method is useful for testing individual nodes or implementing custom execution strategies.

#### ExecuteGraphAsync
Executes a graph composed of provided nodes:

```csharp
Task<FunctionResult> ExecuteGraphAsync(
    IEnumerable<IGraphNode> nodes,
    Kernel kernel,
    KernelArguments arguments,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
```

This method supports conditional routing, branching, or early termination depending on node types and runtime conditions.

### Properties

* `Name`: A human-readable logical name for the executor instance, useful for logging, diagnostics, or multi-executor scenarios

## Execution Semantics

### Lifecycle Management

The executor follows a structured execution lifecycle:

1. **Initialization**: Creates execution context with immutable options snapshot
2. **Validation**: Optionally validates graph integrity before execution
3. **Plan Compilation**: May compile and cache structural execution plans
4. **Node Execution**: Processes nodes sequentially with lifecycle hooks
5. **Completion**: Returns final result or propagates exceptions

### State Management

* **KernelArguments**: Treated as the authoritative execution state
* **GraphState**: Wrapper around KernelArguments with additional metadata
* **Execution Context**: Captures immutable options and execution metadata
* **State Propagation**: Updates are consistently propagated across nodes

### Safety Features

* **Loop Prevention**: Built-in safeguards against infinite loops
* **Timeout Support**: Configurable execution timeouts
* **Cancellation**: Cooperative cancellation via CancellationToken
* **Resource Limits**: Configurable maximum execution steps
* **Integrity Validation**: Optional graph structure validation

### Thread Safety

Instances are generally safe to reuse across executions if no mutable per-run state is kept on the instance itself. The interface does not guarantee thread safety for concurrent executions.

## Implementation Requirements

Implementations are expected to:

* Validate inputs and honor the provided `Kernel` configuration and policies
* Treat `KernelArguments` as the authoritative execution state
* Support cooperative cancellation via `CancellationToken`
* Emit rich logging/telemetry as configured elsewhere in the system
* Handle exceptions appropriately and propagate cancellation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Execution

```csharp
Kernel kernel = BuildKernel();
KernelArguments args = new() { ["input"] = "Hello" };
IGraphExecutor executor = GetExecutor();
FunctionResult result = await executor.ExecuteAsync(kernel, args, CancellationToken.None);
```

### With Cancellation

```csharp
using var cts = new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
var result = await executor.ExecuteAsync(kernel, arguments, cts.Token);
```

### Single Node Execution

```csharp
var node = executor.GetNode("specificNode");
var result = await executor.ExecuteNodeAsync(node, kernel, arguments, cancellationToken);
```

### Custom Node Sequence

```csharp
var customNodes = new[] { node1, node2, node3 };
var result = await executor.ExecuteGraphAsync(customNodes, kernel, arguments, cancellationToken);
```

### Runnable Example

The following is a minimal, fully-runnable example that demonstrates creating a simple graph, adding two function nodes, connecting them, and executing the graph using `GraphExecutor`. This example is the same code shipped in the `examples` folder and has been tested to compile and run.

```csharp
// Minimal runnable example demonstrating how to construct a GraphExecutor,
// add function nodes, connect them, set a start node and execute the graph.
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;
using SemanticKernel.Graph.Core;
using SemanticKernel.Graph.Nodes;
using SemanticKernel.Graph.State;
using System.Threading;

public static class GraphExecutorExample
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Entry point for the docs example. Call from example runner.
    /// </summary>
    public static async Task RunAsync()
    {
        // Create a minimal kernel for function invocation.
        var kernel = Kernel.CreateBuilder().Build();

        // Create simple kernel functions as lightweight delegates to be used by nodes.
        var fnA = KernelFunctionFactory.CreateFromMethod((KernelArguments args) =>
        {
            // Simple function: returns a greeting string
            return "Hello from A";
        }, "FnA");

        var fnB = KernelFunctionFactory.CreateFromMethod((KernelArguments args) =>
        {
            // Echo function: appends text to previous state
            var prev = args.ContainsName("message") ? args["message"]?.ToString() : string.Empty;
            return $"B received: {prev}";
        }, "FnB");

        // Wrap functions into graph nodes
        var nodeA = new FunctionGraphNode(fnA, "nodeA", "Start node A");
        var nodeB = new FunctionGraphNode(fnB, "nodeB", "Receiver node B");

        // Create executor and add nodes
        var executor = new GraphExecutor("ExampleGraph", "A tiny demo graph for docs");
        executor.AddNode(nodeA).AddNode(nodeB);

        // Connect A -> B and set start node
        executor.Connect("nodeA", "nodeB");
        executor.SetStartNode("nodeA");

        // Prepare initial kernel arguments / graph state
        var args = new KernelArguments();
        args["message"] = "Initial message";

        // Execute graph
        var result = await executor.ExecuteAsync(kernel, args, CancellationToken.None);

        // Print final result
        Console.WriteLine("Graph execution completed.");
        Console.WriteLine($"Final result: {result.GetValue<string>()}");
    }
}
```
