# How to build a graph

This guide explains the fundamental steps for creating and configuring graphs in SemanticKernel.Graph. You'll learn how to define nodes, connect them with conditional edges, and execute the resulting workflow.

## Overview

Building a graph involves several key steps:

1. **Create and configure a `Kernel`** with the necessary plugins and functions
2. **Define nodes** (functions, conditionals, loops) that represent your workflow steps
3. **Connect nodes** with conditional edges that control execution flow
4. **Execute** with `GraphExecutor` to run the complete workflow

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Create and Configure Kernel

Start by creating a Semantic Kernel instance with graph support enabled. The examples in this repository use a minimal kernel configured for graph scenarios.

```csharp
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;
using SemanticKernel.Graph.Core;
using SemanticKernel.Graph.Nodes;

// Create a kernel and enable graph support for examples
var kernel = Kernel.CreateBuilder()
    .AddGraphSupport()
    .Build();
```

### 2. Define Graph Nodes

Create nodes that represent different steps in your workflow. For small runnable documentation snippets we provide lightweight kernel functions wrapped into `FunctionGraphNode` instances:

```csharp
// Create lightweight kernel functions for demo purposes
var fnA = KernelFunctionFactory.CreateFromMethod((KernelArguments args) =>
{
    // Returns a simple greeting message
    return "Hello from A";
}, "FnA");

var fnB = KernelFunctionFactory.CreateFromMethod((KernelArguments args) =>
{
    // Echoes previous message from the graph state
    var prev = args.ContainsName("message") ? args["message"]?.ToString() : string.Empty;
    return $"B received: {prev}";
}, "FnB");

// Wrap functions into graph nodes
var nodeA = new FunctionGraphNode(fnA, "nodeA", "Start node A");
var nodeB = new FunctionGraphNode(fnB, "nodeB", "Receiver node B");
```

### 3. Connect Nodes with Edges

Define the flow between nodes using the `GraphExecutor` API. For the minimal example above we connect `nodeA` to `nodeB` and set the start node:

```csharp
var graph = new GraphExecutor("ExampleGraph", "A tiny demo graph for docs");

// Add nodes to the graph
graph.AddNode(nodeA).AddNode(nodeB);

// Connect A -> B and set start node
graph.Connect("nodeA", "nodeB");
graph.SetStartNode("nodeA");
```

### 4. Execute the Graph

Run the complete workflow using `ExecuteAsync`. The example uses `KernelArguments` as initial graph state and prints the final result.

```csharp
// Prepare initial kernel arguments / graph state
var args = new KernelArguments();
args["message"] = "Initial message";

// Execute graph
var result = await graph.ExecuteAsync(kernel, args, CancellationToken.None);

Console.WriteLine("Graph execution completed.");
Console.WriteLine($"Final result: {result.GetValue<string>()}");
```

## Alternative Builder Pattern

For simpler graphs, you can use the fluent builder pattern:

```csharp
var graph = GraphBuilder.Create()
    .AddFunctionNode("plan", kernel, "Planner", "Plan")
    .When(state => state.GetString("needs_analysis") == "yes")
        .AddFunctionNode("analyze", kernel, "Analyzer", "Analyze")
    .AddFunctionNode("act", kernel, "Executor", "Act")
    .Build();
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Conditional Execution

Use conditional edges to create complex branching logic:

```csharp
graph.AddConditionalEdge("start", "branch_a", 
    condition: state => state.GetInt("priority") > 5)
.AddConditionalEdge("start", "branch_b", 
    condition: state => state.GetInt("priority") <= 5);
```

### Loop Control

Implement loops with iteration limits:

```csharp
var loopNode = new WhileGraphNode(
    condition: state => state.GetInt("attempt") < 3,
    maxIterations: 5,
    nodeId: "retry_loop"
);

graph.AddNode(loopNode)
     .AddEdge("start", "retry_loop")
     .AddEdge("retry_loop", "process");
```

### Error Handling

Add error handling nodes to your workflow:

```csharp
var errorHandler = new ErrorHandlerGraphNode(
    errorTypes: new[] { ErrorType.Transient, ErrorType.External },
    recoveryAction: RecoveryAction.Retry,
    maxRetries: 3,
    nodeId: "error_handler"
);

graph.AddNode(errorHandler)
     .AddEdge("process", "error_handler")
     .AddEdge("error_handler", "fallback");
```

## Best Practices

### Node Design

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each node should have one clear purpose
2. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive node IDs that explain their function
3. **State Management**: Design nodes to work with the graph state effectively
4. **Error Handling**: Include error handling nodes for robust workflows

### Graph Structure

1. **Logical Flow**: Organize nodes in a logical sequence
2. **Conditional Logic**: Use conditional edges for dynamic routing
3. **Loop Prevention**: Set appropriate iteration limits to prevent infinite loops
4. **Start Node**: Always define a clear starting point

### Performance Considerations

1. **Node Efficiency**: Optimize individual node performance
2. **State Size**: Keep graph state manageable for memory efficiency
3. **Parallel Execution**: Use parallel nodes where possible for better performance
4. **Caching**: Implement caching for expensive operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Graph not executing**: Ensure you've set a start node with `SetStartNode()`

**Nodes not connected**: Verify all edges are properly defined with `AddEdge()` or `AddConditionalEdge()`

**Infinite loops**: Check loop conditions and set appropriate `maxIterations`

**State not persisting**: Use `GraphState` for persistent state across nodes

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable logging** to trace execution flow
2. **Use breakpoints** in conditional logic
3. **Inspect state** at each node execution
4. **Validate graph integrity** before execution

## Concepts and Techniques

**GraphExecutor**: The main class responsible for executing graph workflows. It manages node execution order, state transitions, and error handling throughout the workflow lifecycle.

**FunctionGraphNode**: A graph node that wraps and executes Semantic Kernel functions. It handles input/output mapping between the graph state and the underlying kernel function.

**ConditionalGraphNode**: A node that evaluates predicates to determine execution flow. It enables dynamic routing based on the current state of the graph.

**ConditionalEdge**: A connection between nodes that includes a condition for execution. It allows for complex branching logic and dynamic workflow paths.

**GraphState**: A wrapper around KernelArguments that provides additional metadata, execution history, and validation capabilities for graph workflows.
