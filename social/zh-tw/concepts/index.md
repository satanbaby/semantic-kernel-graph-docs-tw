# Concepts overview

Core ideas you'll use across the library:

* Graphs: Directed graphs of nodes and conditional edges
* State: Typed wrapper around `KernelArguments` with versioning, validation
* Nodes: Function, Conditional, Loop, ErrorHandler, HumanApproval, Subgraph, etc.
* Execution: Sequential, parallel, distributed; checkpointing and recovery
* Streaming: Real-time events for UI and observability
* Visualization: DOT, Mermaid, JSON outputs for docs and tooling
